# Smart_attendance_system

Hello! I am excited to share with you my project for the Microsoft Engage 2022 mentorship program. 
I have created a smart attendance system that enables you to add unlimited students with the option to update or delete their information. 
This system captures photos and uses facial recognition technology to identify individuals and record their attendance.

Before downloading this repository, ensure that your system meets the following requirements: 
- Desktop development with C++ is installed in Visual Studio 2022. 
- The latest version of Python is installed. 
- Various libraries such as OpenCV, Tkinter, CMake, Dlib, NumPy, and Pandas are installed using pip. 
- If you do not have MySQL installed already, download the latest version. 
- Create a schema named "facerecognition" in MySQL. 
- Within the schema, create a table named "student" with columns for Department, Year, Registration Number, Name, Gender, Phone Number, and Email. 

Now that you have met these requirements, you are ready to clone the repository and begin using the system. Enjoy!
